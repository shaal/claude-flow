## 12. Privacy and Consent Frameworks

### Current State (2026)

The regulatory landscape for biometric and neural data is rapidly evolving, creating complex compliance requirements.

**GDPR and Neural Data:**
- Neural data interpreted as special category under Article 9
- EEG patterns classified as biometric data (unique to individuals)
- Mental state data qualifies as health information
- Explicit consent required: freely given, specific, and informed
- Purpose limitation prohibits data repurposing without fresh consent
- Data minimization requires collecting only essential neural signals

**EU AI Act (Effective 2025):**
- Emotion recognition systems prohibited in workplaces and educational settings
- Medical and safety exemptions exist
- Other contexts classify as high-risk with extensive compliance requirements
- Full rules for high-risk systems apply August 2026

**U.S. State-Level Regulations:**
- **Colorado (2023):** Neural data classified as "sensitive information," opt-in consent required
- **California SB 1223 (2024):** Neural data explicitly classified as sensitive personal information
- **Montana SB 163 (October 2025):** Neurotechnology data regulated via amended GIPA

**International Frameworks:**
- **Chile:** Constitutional amendment protecting mental integrity as human right
- **UNESCO:** Proposed treating mental privacy as fundamental right, banning non-consensual emotional analysis
- **UN Guidance:** "Precautionary principle" safeguards, prohibitions on mental manipulation

### Projected Evolution

**Consent Innovations:**
- Granular consent for specific data types and uses
- Visual consent interfaces showing data flows
- Consent expiration and automatic deletion
- Consent inheritance for derived data
- Collective consent mechanisms for group experiences

#### Phase 2: Cognitive Rights Era (2033-2038)

- **Mental integrity protections:** Legal frameworks for thought privacy
- **Cognitive liberty:** Right to mental self-determination
- **Neural data sovereignty:** Individual ownership of brain data
- **Algorithmic transparency:** Right to understand AI decisions affecting experience
- **Forgetting rights:** Right to delete memories and experiences from systems

#### Phase 3: Post-Biological Privacy (2039-2046)

- **Consciousness protection:** Legal status for mental experiences
- **Collective privacy:** Rights for shared consciousness experiences
- **Trans-human identity rights:** Legal framework for enhanced humans
- **Reality privacy:** Protection from unwanted reality manipulation
